					<p id="read">A pencil (/ˈpɛnsəl/ (listen)) is a writing or drawing implement with a solid pigment core encased in a 
						sleeve, barrel, or shaft that prevents breaking the core or marking a user's hand.</p>
					<p>Pencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface.
						 They are distinct from pens, which dispense liquid or gel ink onto the marked surface.</p>
					<p>Most pencil cores are made of graphite powder mixed with a clay binder. Graphite pencils (traditionally known as "lead pencils") produce 
						grey or black marks that are easily erased, but otherwise resistant to moisture, most chemicals, ultraviolet radiation and natural aging. 
						Other types of pencil cores, such as those of charcoal, are mainly used for drawing and sketching. Coloured pencils are sometimes used by
						 teachers or editors to correct submitted texts, but are typically regarded as art supplies, especially those with cores made from wax-based 
						 binders that tend to smear when erasers are applied to them. 
						Grease pencils have a softer, oily core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain.</p>
					<p>The most common pencil casing is thin wood, usually hexagonal in section but sometimes cylindrical or triangular, permanently
						 bonded to the core. Casings may be of other materials, such as plastic or paper. To use the pencil, the casing must be carved 
						 or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point. Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which are 
						 not bonded to the core; instead, they support separate, mobile pigment cores that can be extended or retracted (usually through 
						 the casing's tip) 
						as needed. These casings can be reloaded with new cores (usually graphite) as the previous ones are exhausted.</p>

					<h3>Camel's hair</h3>
					<p>Pencil, from Old French pincel, from Latin penicillus a "little tail" (see penis; pincellus is Latin from the post-classical period[1])
						 originally referred to an artist's fine brush of camel hair, also used for writing before modern lead or chalk pencils.[2]</p>
					<p>Though the archetypal pencil was an artist's brush, the stylus, a thin metal stick used for scratching in papyrus or wax tablets, 
						was used extensively by the Romans[3] and for palm-leaf manuscripts.</p>
					<p>At persius imperdiet vis, ea elit atqui aperiri mei, percipit maiestatis sea eu. Has et partem hendrerit, vim cibo 
						veniam aliquid an. No pri populo abhorreant, everti mandamus ne mea. Debitis forensibus suscipiantur ius cu. Ei 
						per possim verterem, et iudico voluptatum eos.</p>
					<h3 id="view">Graphite deposit discoveries</h3>
					<p>As a technique for drawing, the closest predecessor to the pencil was silverpoint or leadpoint until in 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500)
						, a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, 
						England.[4][5][6][7] This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. It remains 
						the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form.[8] Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be 
						a form of lead. Consequently, it was called plumbago (Latin for "lead ore").[9][10] Because the pencil core is still referred to as "lead", 
						or "a lead", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead,[11] and the black core of pencils is still referred 
						to as lead, even though it never contained the element lead.[12][13][14][15][16] The words for pencil in German (Bleistift),
						 Irish (peann luaidhe), Arabic (قلم رصاص qalam raṣāṣ), and some other languages literally mean lead pen.</p>
					<p>The value of graphite would soon be realised to be enormous, mainly because it could be used to line the moulds for cannonballs; 
						the mines were taken over by the Crown and were guarded.
						 When sufficient stores of graphite had been accumulated, the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required.</p>
					<p>The usefulness of graphite for pencils was discovered as well, but graphite for pencils had to be smuggled. Because graphite is soft, 
						it requires some form of encasement. Graphite sticks were initially wrapped in string or sheepskin for stability. England would enjoy
						 a monopoly on the production of pencils until a method of reconstituting the graphite powder was found in 1662 in Italy. However,
						 the distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s. </p>
					<h2>Wood encasement</h2>
					<p>Around 1560,[19] an Italian couple named Simonio and Lyndiana Bernacotti made what are likely the first blueprints for the modern,
						 wood-encased carpentry pencil. Their version was a flat, oval, more compact type of pencil. Their concept involved the hollowing 
						 out of a stick of juniper wood. Shortly thereafter, a superior technique was discovered: two wooden 
						halves were carved, a graphite stick inserted, and the halves then glued together—essentially the same method in use to this day.[20]</p>
